I recently completed a live weather web application project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application is capable of displaying real-time weather information based on the user specified location. I used CSS to style the application, including selecting colors, fonts, and layout for various sections. To retrieve the weather data from an API, I wrote JavaScript code to update the HTML with the current weather conditions, which include temperature, humidity, and wind speed. In addition, I added features like a search bar to enable users to search for weather information by city. The application also displays weather icons to visually represent the current weather conditions, which I implemented using JavaScript. Overall, I'm very pleased with the outcome of this project and the skills I've gained while working on it.
